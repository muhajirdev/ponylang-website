Pony version 0.12.0 has been released. It's available via all the usual channels. This is a recommended update as [PR #1768](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/1768) fixed a memory related issue that could result in nastiness.
<!--more-->

The release also features a breaking change in the form of [PR #1741](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/1741) which implemented the "Array as Sequences" RFC. It changes the syntax for creating arrays from: `['a', 'b', 'c']` to: `['a'; 'b'; 'c']`.

Enjoy!
