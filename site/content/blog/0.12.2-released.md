Thanks to Gordon Tisher for finding the cause of our extreme busy wait problem on Windows and issuing a fix for it. We consider that a high priority issue which means, release away. Since it's only been a day since our last release, not a lot else in this one.

Windows, Debian and RedHat packages are available via Bintray. OSX via Homebrew should be coming soon.

### Fixed

- Fix extreme CPU use in scheduler on Windows (PR #1785)
- Fix broken ponytest "only" filter (PR #1780)
